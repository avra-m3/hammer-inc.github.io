Incode was born out of a subject I took during my second semester at RMIT.

While researching a form of error correction, known as a 'Hamming Code', I was unable to find any sites which made the calculation of the error
correction code easy to understand, thus 'Incode' was born.

The project is built using a React/MaterialUI frontend plus a Flask backend.
