As a club at RMIT, welcome day is chaos. Between signing up students, interacting with first years, and handing out bribes; There is a lot to do.

When I was VP of the CSIT society, I had an idea - what if we could sign students up to our club using their existing student identification?
In order to achieve this, we'd need their name, student number and email.
